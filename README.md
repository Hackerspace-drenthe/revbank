# NAME

revbank - Banking for hackerspace visitors

# DESCRIPTION

Maybe I'll write some documentation, but not now.

Shell-like invocation with `-c` is supported, sort of, but it has to be a
complete command. Currently, multiple commands are supported on the command
line (space separated), but that's an unintended feature...

# PLUGINS

Refer to [RevBank::Plugins](https://metacpan.org/pod/RevBank::Plugins) for documentation about writing plugins.

Plugins themselves may have some documentation in the respective plugin files.
